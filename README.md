# drone

This is an assignment project built using Mapbox GL JS and vanilla JavaScript & CSS

Created a stores variable with GeoJSON data for approx. 50 drones. I have used webpack to keep the project modular,
in case some more features need to added later.

This project can be easily tweaked to recieved realtime data with AJAX call using an API
